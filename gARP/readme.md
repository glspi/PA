# gARP - Gratuitous ARP Script
This was built (in hopes) to replace the existing Excel spreadsheet that was being used for new PA installs.

Requires these Python Modules:
>ipcalc, requests, xmltodict, lxml, json

>try: pip3 install ipcalc requests xmltodict lxml json

## api_lib_pa.py
This is my ever-expanding PA API python library. To be used for various XML/JSON calls to PA or Panorama.

## garp.py
Main program

Connects to either PA or Panorama, looks through interfaces and NAT rules, and produces output for gratuitious arp.

ie. *test arp gratuitous ip 192.168.10.1 interface ethernet1/2*

Currently works on source-nat only, but outputs the relevant 'other' NAT's including their configuration to a file, 
 to help review them individually.

If using Panorama, currently only POST NAT rules are evaluated(this can easily be updated if needed, just ask)

Any interfaces or NAT rules that exist ONLY on the PA (not Panorama), should be generated by connecting directly to the PA.

SAFE! - Only 'GET' commands are sent to the PA/Panorama. The 'test arp' command output is printed out via console.



Please provide the following arguments:

> **python3 garp.py <PA/Panorama IP> \<username\> \<optional output folder\>**
